# Allen Coral Atlas
Google Earth Engine code repository

## Background
The Allen Coral Atlas brings together partners from Planet, University of Queensland, Arizona State University's Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science (GDCS), the National Geographic Society and Vulcan Inc. to take high resolution satellite imagery and advanced analytics to map and monitor the worldâ€™s coral reefs in unprecedented detail.  
See the [Allen Coral Atlas website](https://allencoralatlas.org/) for more information.  
See [the organisation repository](https://github.com/CoralMapping/AllenCoralAtlas) for an overview of the resources, citation info, standards and publications arising from the Allen Coral Atlas.  

## Code  
This repo contains all the Google Earth Engine source code that generates the mapping outputs on the Coral Atlas, including maps and validation statistics.  
Several scientific publications cover the methodological and applied background to the mapping code in this repo.   

### Earth Engine source code for mapping algorithms  
This paper covers the underlying mapping framework that is enabling the geomorphic and benthic mapping component of te Allen Coral Atlas, including image and derived data sources, Google Earth Engine methods and validation approaches.
