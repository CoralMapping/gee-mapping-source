/*
Little test case to join maps from different sub-regions

This is potentially useful when a mapping region contains different 
reef types, where the different reef types are mapped better by different
trianing data sets or algorithm specifications

TODO: polygons to be auto-generated based on apriori information,
        for the meantime they are manual
